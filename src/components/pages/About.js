        Shortly after graduating with my Bachelors degree in Sports and Exercise Science, I decided to embark on the path of becoming a web developer.
        While on this journey, I will be attempting to combine the best of brains and brawns. 
        My goal wil be to successfully create applications that are easy to use and understand by a common person but also high-level enough for athletes of different experiences to enjoy.
